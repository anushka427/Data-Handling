## Features
- **EDA Automation**: Quickly perform basic statistical analysis and visualize data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove missing values, handle outliers, and normalize data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and transform features to improve model performance.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots using popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

---

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run the scripts and notebooks:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)

To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-handling.git
cd data-handling
```

---

## Usage
1. **EDA Notebook**: Open `notebooks/eda_example.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to run a sample EDA.
2. **Data Cleaning Script**: Use `scripts/data_cleaning.py` to clean your dataset.
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_cleaning.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/cleaned_data.csv
   ```
3. **Visualization Script**: Generate basic plots using `scripts/data_visualization.py`.
